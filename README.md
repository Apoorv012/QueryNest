# 🪶 QueryNest

**QueryNest** is a smart file search app built with **Flutter** and **Vector Databases**.  
Instead of searching files by their names, QueryNest lets you **ask questions** or provide a **topic**, and it finds the most relevant files based on meaning (semantic search).  

---

## ✨ Features
- 📂 Add and manage multiple files in the app.  
- 🔍 Semantic search powered by **embeddings + vector DB** (meaning-based search, not just filename).  
- 🧠 Ask natural language questions to retrieve files.  
- 📱 Built with **Flutter** for cross-platform support.  
- ⚡ Supports both **browser/web preview** and **real device testing**.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Flutter  
- **Backend/Vector Store:** Python + Vector DB (FAISS)  
- **Platform:** Works on Android, iOS (with Mac for builds), Web, and Desktop
